# üéÆ Block Puzzle Game ‚Äì Code in Place Final Project

This is a fun and colorful **Block Puzzle Game** made using **Python** and **Pygame**. The goal of the game is to place falling blocks on a grid and match **three or more blocks of the same color** (either vertically or horizontally) to clear them and earn points.

## üß† How the Game Works

- Blocks fall from the top in different shapes and colors.
- You can **move** the blocks left, right, or down using the arrow keys.
- Match **3 or more same-colored blocks** in a row or column to clear them.
- Score points for:

  - Matching 3+ same-color blocks: **+10 points per block**
  - Clearing a full row: **+100 points**

- The game gets **faster** once your score goes above **160**.

- Some blocks are already placed on the grid to make it more challenging.
